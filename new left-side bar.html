                                    <p>This research analysis delves into the profound influence that the act of digital writing has had on the traditional writing process. It sheds light on the transformative nature of technology in shaping how we compose and communicate. This essay seeks to analyze the multi-faceted ways in which digital writing alters the fundamental stages of writing; including how writers are able to distribute their work, how it changes the tools essential to the writing process, and how the act of writing is taught in schools. By scrutinizing the intersection of technology and the writing process, this essay aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the evolving nature of composition in a growing digital age.</p>

                                 <p>This essay critically examines the intersection of the digital divide and the COVID-19 pandemic; exploring its impact on education, healthcare, employment, and societal well-being. As society grappled with the profound changes brought about by the pandemic, digital tools were hailed as potential saviours. However, this essay examines how these tools not only failed to meet their promises, but also exacerbated existing inequalities; deepening the fissures of the digital divide. Drawing lessons from the pandemic, this essay calls for a need to bridge the digital gap and foster a more equitable and resilient society in the face of future global crises.</p>

                                <p>This essay examines the transformative impact of social media on the #MeToo movement, unravelling the dynamic interplay between digital platforms and the advocacy for survivors of sexual harassment and assault. Through a global and geographic lens, this paper investigates how the #MeToo movement inspired challenge and change in different cultures through a social, political, and legal context. By tracing the evolution of the movement from its inception to its global resonance, this essay explores how social media serves as a powerful catalyst for collective action, empowerment, and the redefinition of social norms surrounding issues of gender-based violence. </p>

                                  <h3 class="major"><u>GAWAIN VS. LANCELOT: A CONTRAST OF ARTHURIAN HEROES</u></h3></a>
                                <p>This literature-based essay explores the contrasting personas of Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot within the realm of the Arthurian legend, shedding light on the divergent paths these iconic knights take as embodiment of chivalric ideas. Positioned as exemplars of King Arthur’s Round Table, Gawain and Lancelot both represent distinct archetypes of medieval heroism; each embodying virtues and flaws that reflect the broader cultural values of their time. Gawain, often portrayed in light of the English tradition, stands in stark contrast to Lancelot, who is often characterized with many of the ideals of the French romance. Thus, the following essay explores how these two Arthurian heroes are reflections of the time periods in which they stemmed from, in order to determine which literary tradition prevailed long after the medieval period was over. </p>

                                    <h3 class="major"><u>INTERRACIAL REPRESENTATION IN ROMANTIC LITERATURE</u></h3></a>
                                <p>This essay delves into the exploration of interracial relationships and their portrayal in Romantic literature during a period marked by a re-evaluation of gender and sexuality norms. With a focus on the intersectionality of race and romance, this paper focuses on two specific texts, Charlotte Dacre’s “Zofloya, or the Moor” and Anonymous’ “The Women of Colour: A Tale.” It attempts to highlight the unique dynamics and treatment of two racially diverse pairings through a lens marked by miscegenation, female sexual desire, and feminine virtue. By scrutinizing these narratives, this essay aims to uncover the ways in which the controversy surrounding interracial representation in Romantic literature left a lasting impressing on the literary tradition of its time. </p>
